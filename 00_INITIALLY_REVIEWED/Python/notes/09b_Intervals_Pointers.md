# Intervals & Pointer Patterns

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Pattern Best Practices</strong></summary>

```python
# ðŸš¨ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
# 1. Intervals: Not sorting by the right criteria (start vs end time)
# 2. Fast/Slow Pointers: Off-by-one errors in cycle detection
# 3. Sliding Window: Not handling edge cases (empty arrays, k > n)

# âœ… BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Intervals: Draw timeline diagrams to visualize overlaps
# 2. Two Pointers: Consider if array needs to be sorted first
# 3. Pattern Recognition: Many problems have multiple solution approaches

# ðŸŽ¯ WHEN TO USE EACH PATTERN:
# - Intervals: Scheduling, merging, overlapping problems
# - Fast/Slow Pointers: Cycle detection, finding middle element
# - Sliding Window: Subarray/substring problems with constraints
```

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for processing
# Space Complexity: O(n) for result

# ðŸŽ¯ INTERVAL PROBLEM PATTERNS:
# 1. Merge overlapping intervals
# 2. Insert new interval
# 3. Remove minimum intervals to make non-overlapping
# 4. Find maximum non-overlapping intervals

# Merge Intervals
# Problem: Merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    # Sort by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        
        # Check if intervals overlap
        if current[0] <= last[1]:
            # Merge intervals
            merged[-1] = [last[0], max(last[1], current[1])]
        else:
            # No overlap, add new interval
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: Always sort by start time for merging problems
# Key condition: start <= last_end means overlapping

# Insert Interval
# Problem: Insert new interval into sorted non-overlapping intervals list
def insert_interval(intervals, new_interval):
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(intervals)
    
    # Add all intervals that end before new interval starts
    while i < n and intervals[i][1] < new_interval[0]:
        result.append(intervals[i])
        i += 1
    
    # Merge overlapping intervals
    while i < n and intervals[i][0] <= new_interval[1]:
        new_interval[0] = min(new_interval[0], intervals[i][0])
        new_interval[1] = max(new_interval[1], intervals[i][1])
        i += 1
    
    result.append(new_interval)
    
    # Add remaining intervals
    while i < n:
        result.append(intervals[i])
        i += 1
    
    return result

# ðŸš¨ COMMON MISTAKE: Wrong overlap condition
# Correct: intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1] (start <= end)
# Wrong: intervals[i][0] < newInterval[1] (misses touching intervals)

# Non-overlapping Intervals
# Problem: Find minimum number of intervals to remove to make rest non-overlapping
def erase_overlap_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0
    
    # Sort by end time (greedy approach)

            count += 1
        else:
            # Update last_end to current interval's end
            last_end = intervals[i][1]
    
    return count

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: Greedy approach - always keep interval with earliest end time
# This leaves maximum room for future intervals

# Meeting Rooms II
# Problem: Find minimum number of meeting rooms required
def min_meeting_rooms(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0
    
    # Separate start and end times

            # Meeting starts, need a room
            rooms += 1
            max_rooms = max(max_rooms, rooms)
            start_ptr += 1
        else:

            rooms -= 1
            end_ptr += 1
    
    return max_rooms

# ðŸš€ ALTERNATIVE: Using heap (more intuitive)
def min_meeting_rooms_heap(intervals):
    import heapq
    
    if not intervals:
        return 0
    
    # Sort by start time

        # Add current meeting's end time
        heapq.heappush(heap, end)
    
    return len(heap)

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: Two approaches for meeting rooms:
# 1. Two pointers on sorted start/end times (more efficient)
# 2. Heap to track end times (more intuitive)

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n) for most two-pointer problems

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: If there's a cycle, fast will eventually catch up to slow

# ðŸ§  MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT: Why does this work?
# If cycle starts at distance 'a' from head and has length 'c':
# When they meet, slow traveled 'a + b', fast traveled 'a + b + c'
# Since fast = 2 * slow: a + b + c = 2(a + b) â†’ c = a + b
