# Weighted Graph Algorithms

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Weighted Graph Best Practices</strong></summary>

```python
# ðŸš¨ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
# 1. Dijkstra: Using with negative weights (use Bellman-Ford instead)
# 2. Bellman-Ford: Not detecting negative cycles properly
# 3. Floyd-Warshall: Forgetting to initialize diagonal to 0
# 4. MST: Not sorting edges properly for Kruskal's algorithm
# 5. All algorithms: Off-by-one errors in adjacency matrix indexing

# âœ… BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Always check for negative weights before choosing algorithm
# 2. Use appropriate data structures (min-heap for Dijkstra)
# 3. Handle disconnected graphs properly
# 4. Consider space vs time trade-offs (adjacency list vs matrix)
# 5. Test with edge cases: single node, no edges, negative cycles

# ðŸŽ¯ ALGORITHM SELECTION GUIDE:
# - Single source shortest path (no negative weights): Dijkstra's
# - Single source shortest path (with negative weights): Bellman-Ford
# - All pairs shortest path: Floyd-Warshall
# - Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal's or Prim's
# - Detect negative cycles: Bellman-Ford
