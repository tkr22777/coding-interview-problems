# Fast & Slow Pointers

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Fast/Slow Pointer Best Practices</strong></summary>

```python
# ðŸš¨ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
# 1. Fast/Slow Pointers: Off-by-one errors in cycle detection
# 2. Not handling edge cases (empty list, single node)
# 3. Forgetting to check if fast.next exists before fast.next.next
# 4. Wrong mathematical reasoning for cycle detection

# âœ… BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Always check fast and fast.next before moving fast pointer
# 2. Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm for cycle problems
# 3. Two-phase approach: detect cycle, then find cycle start
# 4. Consider dummy node for edge cases in linked list modifications

# ðŸŽ¯ WHEN TO USE FAST/SLOW POINTERS:
# - Cycle detection in linked lists or arrays
# - Finding middle element of linked list
# - Detecting palindromes in linked lists
# - Removing nth node from end
```

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n) for most two-pointer problems
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# ðŸ§  KEY INSIGHT: Fast/slow pointers detect cycles and find middle elements
# Fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 step - they meet if there's a cycle

# Linked List Cycle
# Problem: Detect if linked list has a cycle
def has_cycle(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return False
    
    slow = fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    return False

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: If there's a cycle, fast will eventually catch up to slow
# Think of it as two runners on a circular track

# Find Cycle Start
# Problem: Find the node where cycle begins
def detect_cycle(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return None
    
    # Phase 1: Detect if cycle exists
    slow = fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
        if slow == fast:
            break
    else:
        return None  # No cycle
    
    # Phase 2: Find cycle start
    # Move one pointer to head, keep other at meeting point
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    
    return slow

# ðŸ§  MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT: Why does this work?
# If cycle starts at distance 'a' from head and has length 'c':
# When they meet, slow traveled 'a + b', fast traveled 'a + b + c'
# Since fast = 2 * slow: a + b + c = 2(a + b) â†’ c = a + b
# So distance from head to cycle start = distance from meeting point to cycle start

# Find Duplicate Number
# Problem: Find duplicate number in array containing n+1 integers from 1 to n

    # Treat array as implicit linked list

        slow = nums[slow]

# ðŸ’¡ INSIGHT: This is Floyd's cycle detection applied to arrays!
# The duplicate number is the "cycle start" in the implicit linked list
