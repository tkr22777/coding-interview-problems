<summary><strong>üí° Advanced Patterns Best Practices & Common Pitfalls</strong></summary>

```python
# üö® COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
# 1. Union-Find: Forgetting path compression or union by rank
# 2. Monotonic Stack: Not understanding when to use increasing vs decreasing
# 3. Intervals: Not sorting by the right criteria (start vs end time)
# 4. Fast/Slow Pointers: Off-by-one errors in cycle detection
# 5. Sliding Window: Not handling edge cases (empty arrays, k > n)

# ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Union-Find: Always implement both optimizations (path compression + union by rank)
# 2. Monotonic Stack: Think about what you're trying to find (next greater/smaller)
# 3. Intervals: Draw timeline diagrams to visualize overlaps
# 4. Two Pointers: Consider if array needs to be sorted first
# 5. Pattern Recognition: Many problems have multiple solution approaches

# üéØ WHEN TO USE EACH PATTERN:
# - Union-Find: Connected components, cycle detection in undirected graphs
# - Monotonic Stack: Next greater/smaller element problems
# - Intervals: Scheduling, merging, overlapping problems
# - Fast/Slow Pointers: Cycle detection, finding middle element
# - Sliding Window: Subarray/substring problems with constraints

# - DFS: O(m*n) time, O(m*n) space (recursion stack)

<summary><strong>Monotonic Stack/Queue</strong></summary>

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n) for most monotonic stack problems
# Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack

# üß† KEY INSIGHT: Monotonic stack helps find "next greater/smaller" efficiently
# - Increasing stack: Find next smaller element
# - Decreasing stack: Find next greater element

# Daily Temperatures

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for processing
# Space Complexity: O(n) for result

# üéØ INTERVAL PROBLEM PATTERNS:
# 1. Merge overlapping intervals
# 2. Insert new interval
# 3. Remove minimum intervals to make non-overlapping
# 4. Find maximum non-overlapping intervals

# Merge Intervals
# Problem: Merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals
