<summary><strong>Interview Prep: Debug Prints Are Essential</strong></summary>

**Always add debug prints during practice - they're the foundation of confident problem solving**

### Why Debug Prints Matter:
- Validate thought process step-by-step
- Build confidence with intermediate results  
- Catch logical errors early
- Demonstrate systematic thinking to interviewers

### Key Debug Points:
- After data structure creation (maps, arrays)
- Before/after major transformations
- Inside loops (iteration state)
- At decision points
- Before returning results

```python
print(f"frequency_map: {frequency_map}")
print(f"iteration {i}: state={state}, remaining={remaining}")
print(f"condition: {condition}, result: {result}")
```
