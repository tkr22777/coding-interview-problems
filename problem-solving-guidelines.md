# Problem-Solving Guidelines

<summary><strong>Problem-Solving Mindset: Step-by-Step Approach</strong></summary>

### 1. **Understand the Problem First**
- Read carefully, identify inputs/outputs and constraints
- Think about edge cases and examples
- Don't jump to implementation immediately

### 2. **Think Strategy Before Code**
- Consider multiple approaches (brute force, optimized, different data structures)
- Analyze time/space complexity trade-offs
- Choose the approach that fits the constraints

### 3. **Choose Your Development Path**
- **Bottom-up approach**: When you're confident about the strategy
  - Test core functions with single elements first
  - Build confidence in downstream components
  - Then integrate upstream
- **Iterative approach**: When exploring or uncertain
  - Start with trivial/brute force solution
  - Evolve and optimize incrementally
  - Refactor as understanding improves

### 4. **Debug with Intention**
- Add debug prints at key decision points
- Validate intermediate results and data structures
- Print loop states and transformations
- Verify your logic step-by-step

### 5. **Test and Validate**
- Test with simple cases first
- Verify edge cases and constraints
- Ensure your solution handles all scenarios
