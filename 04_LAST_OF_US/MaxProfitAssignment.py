Maximum Profit Assignment
Assign jobs to workers to maximize total profit.

Given:
- difficulty[i]: Difficulty level of ith job
- profit[i]: Profit of ith job
- worker[j]: Ability level of jth worker

A worker can only be assigned to a job if their ability >= job difficulty.
Each worker can be assigned at most one job, but jobs can remain unassigned.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve.

Example: 
- difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
- Maximum profit = 100 (worker with ability 4â†’job with difficulty 4 (profit 20), etc.)

Time Complexity: O(n log n + m log n) where n = jobs, m = workers
Space Complexity: O(n) for the sorted job arrays

            1. We're looking for the rightmost index where difficulty <= worker ability
