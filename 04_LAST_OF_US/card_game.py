# Problem 3: Multiplayer Card Game
# Step 1: Basic Game Setup
# Create a basic setup for a multiplayer card game where users can join the game, and a deck of cards is shuffled and distributed among the players.
#
# Implement functions to create a game room, join a game, shuffle the deck, and distribute cards evenly among players.

# Step 2: Basic Gameplay Mechanics
# Extend the game to support basic gameplay mechanics, such as playing a card, drawing a card from the deck, and keeping track of each playerâ€™s hand.
#
# Implement functions for players to play a card and draw a card from the deck.
# Maintain the state of each player's hand and update it as cards are played or drawn.

# Step 3: Game Rules and Winning Conditions
# Add game rules and conditions to determine the winner. Define the rules for valid moves and implement a scoring system or winning conditions.
#
# Implement functions to check if a move is valid based on the game rules.
# Keep track of the scores or conditions required for a player to win the game.
# Implement logic to determine and announce the winner.
# Step 4: Concurrency Control for Multi-player Interaction
# Introduce concurrency control to handle simultaneous actions from multiple players, such as playing cards or drawing from the deck, ensuring the game state remains consistent.
#
# Implement locks or other synchronization mechanisms to manage concurrent actions.
# Ensure that the game state is accurately updated even with high concurrency.
# Step 5: Real-time Updates and Synchronization
# Enhance the game with real-time updates so all players see the current state of the game (e.g., played cards, current hands, scores) without delay.
#
# Implement WebSocket or similar real-time communication to broadcast game state changes to all players.
# Ensure that all players receive accurate and timely updates by managing concurrency and synchronization properly.
# Step 6: Chat Feature
# Add a chat feature to allow players to communicate with each other during the game.
#
# Implement a chat system where players can send and receive messages.
# Ensure that messages are displayed in real-time to all players.
# Step 7: Reconnection and Persistence
# Allow players to reconnect to the game if they lose their connection and persist the game state to prevent data loss.
#
# Implement a mechanism for players to reconnect to the game and restore their previous state.
# Use a database or in-memory store to persist the game state and player information.
# Summary of Steps
# Basic Game Setup: Game room creation, joining, shuffling, and card distribution.
# Basic Gameplay Mechanics: Playing and drawing cards, managing player hands.
# Game Rules and Winning Conditions: Valid moves, scoring system, determining the winner.
# Concurrency Control: Managing simultaneous actions, ensuring game state consistency.
# Real-time Updates and Synchronization: Broadcasting game state changes in real-time.
# Chat Feature: Real-time player communication.
# Reconnection and Persistence: Handling reconnections and persisting game state.
# This problem progressively adds new features and complexities, requiring updates to previous implementations and incorporating concurrency control to ensure a consistent and synchronized game experience.
